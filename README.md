I'm ready to make a difference!
My first attempt at creating a website was back in the 90s. It was so fun that I wanted to make a career out of it. Then, you guessed it, life happens. I had a third baby, a healthy boy. Then about 16 months later I had my last baby. A baby girl in 2001 in May. 
Then after seeing that in all the want ads wanted someone with a degree, I went to college a few years later and got my BFA in web design. After much discouragement with not finding a job near me I gave up, but not completely. I also now have a masters in IT with a special focus in cybersecurity.
